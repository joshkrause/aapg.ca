GoToAssist:
Your representative, Ryan has arrived.

Ryan (11:10:08):
Hi there, how can I help you?

City Of Medicine Hat (11:11:06):
Hi Ryan, I'm doing some work with your API, and having trouble retrieving the Appointments using a GET request
City Of Medicine Hat (11:13:01):
I have all the login credentials and /api/2.0/Status said It was working, I also was able to call /api/2.0/Organizations/22482/Locations and it returned the data I expected

Ryan (11:13:30):
I see
Ryan (11:14:05):
What does your get request look like?

City Of Medicine Hat (11:14:39):
but when I call /api/2.0/Organizations/22482/Appointments , i get a message Message: "The requested resource does not support http method 'GET'."
City Of Medicine Hat (11:15:22):
here is the php code I am using
City Of Medicine Hat (11:15:30):
$ch = curl_init( 'https://cityofmedicinehat.perfectmind.com/api/2.0/Organizations/22482/Locations/07295a47-8b6c-42d8-a893-82dd997fb3e3/Appointments' );

        curl_setopt( $ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, TRUE );
        curl_setopt( $ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(
        'X-Access-Key: 9A3um5i4svxVCSU5JKUvajB61A06goaq',
        'X-Client-Number: 22482',
        'X-Username: josh@tride.ca',
        'X-Password: coolcool2',

Ryan (11:17:14):
This call should return public appointments - do you currently have appointments set to public visibility?

City Of Medicine Hat (11:18:59):
I actually don't have anything to do with making the appointments, so I'm not sure if they are public or not.

Ryan (11:19:42):
Hmm, let me check the DB to see if there are

City Of Medicine Hat (11:21:25):
Thanks

Ryan (11:27:11):
HI John,  I see nothing wrong with the auth token, nor the API call.  I also see  at least a few appointments labelled public.  There may be something wrong.
Ryan (11:29:05):
I am going to create a case and send it to our quality assurance team for review

City Of Medicine Hat (11:30:49):
ok thank you. could you get back to john@tride.ca after someone has a look at it?

Ryan (11:31:31):
Yes - I will send you an email with the case number as well

City Of Medicine Hat (11:32:10):
Awesome. Thanks for checking it out for me.

Ryan (11:32:26):
No problem John, anything else you wanted to bring up here?

City Of Medicine Hat (11:36:29):
just that GET '/api/2.0/Organizations/22482/Appointments' and GET '/api/2.0/Organizations/22482/Locations/{locationsId}/Appointments' are the ones I need and both are returning : Message: "The requested resource does not support http method 'GET'."

Ryan (11:37:05):
Roger that - I will find out what's going on wrong there.

City Of Medicine Hat (11:37:28):
Ok. Thanks Ryan.
