                <p>We maintain a frequent relationship with the Solicitor Generals office and do our best to help our members with any questions or concerns they might find difficult to get answers from within the Solicitor Generals' office.  We are the 'push', when needed, and lobby on behalf of membership Resolutions.</p>

                <p>We provide template examples for your document needs, so you can view what other communities do, and save the time of starting from scratch.  (We have a new website under development, and anticipate the document link to be available within the next 30-days - but we can manually email you available documents, as requested).  We have found our Associate members use this area for RCMP oversight bylaw examples.</p>

                <p>Our Board is active in calling, or meeting directly with, your municipal representatives to assist you with any questions or concerns.</p>

                <p>Most of our individual members would report that their main benefit is having opportunities for in-person discussions and training/information gathering at our conference.  This is especially true for new Advisory/Committee/Commission members.</p>

                <p>Members have the opportunity to apply to sit on the ALERT Civilian Advisory Committee and offer a proposal to Host our annual Conference in their municipality.</p>

                <p>New Members also receive discounted Conference registration fee ($200pp) the first year of membership.</p>

                <p>We would like you to be a member, we would be very happy to discuss further or answer any questions you may have.  Membership application is easy.</p>
